# Java Graphics Example

This project lets you easily make little games or other interactive projects in Java.

## Getting started

Download the project as a ZIP by clicking on the green "Code" button in the upper right. Unzip the folder and open it up in VS Code.

GraphicsExample.java is the file containing the main function. You should be able to click "Run" and immediately start running the example! Also, you can hover over any class name or function name to get more info about what it does and how you might be able to change it.

Feel free to play around with the example and change things to your liking, or delete the contents of the loop and trying making something of your own!
